The so called swaps push-out provision, now repealed, required banks to separate their speculative business in derivatives from depository banking covered by government insurance and further protected by the Federal Reserve. The broader budget deal, technically a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through next September, also cut a lot of needed public spending and added several odious riders, including one that raises the ceiling on individual campaign contributions to party committees about tenfold. Had Democrats resolutely opposed the deal, I argued, it would have revealed Republicans as friends of Wall Street and enemies of Main Street -- a useful party differentiation between now and 2016.', '"the category for the article: "What is Elizabeth Warren up to?

If Clinton does pull out a win, it ends Sanders\' streak and all but guarantees Clinton\'s nomination. If, on the other hand, Sanders should narrowly win, it doesn\'t mean he wins the nomination -- the two will split New York\'s delegates almost evenly. His path to a delegate majority would still be exceedingly steep. But a Sanders win, which would make eight out of the last nine, would reinforce the impression that he\'s the one with momentum. And it would put the remaining states, most notably Pennsylvania and California, seriously in play.
